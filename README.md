# Fundamental AI – Lab 3  
Sampling Plans & Space-Filling Metrics

This repository contains the source code used for **Lab 3** of the course  
**Fundamental Artificial Intelligence (23TNT1)**.

## Contents
- `LAB_3/experiment_01.ipynb`  
  Implementation of sampling plans and space-filling metrics:
  - Random Sampling
  - Additive Recurrence
  - Halton sequence
  - Sobol sequence
  - Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)

- Experiments include:
  - Star-discrepancy (Monte Carlo approximation)
  - Nearest-neighbor distance
  - Morris–Mitchell Φ_q metrics
  - Visualization and comparison

## How to run
The experiments were executed using **Google Colab**.  
A public Colab notebook is provided for reproducibility.
